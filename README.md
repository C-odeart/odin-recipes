Create a recipe page to showcase basic HTML.

This is the very first project in The Odin Project curriculam. While doing this project, I have learned how to fill out the HTML boilerplate, navigate through the terminal, create files and directories, input headers, paragraphs, lists(ordered and unordered), links and images. I have also learned the basic git workflow needed to stage, commit and push my code.
