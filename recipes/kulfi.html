    <h2>Description</h2>
    Kulfi is a frozen dairy dessert originating in the Delhi under the Mughal Empire[2] during the Mughal era in the 16th century. It is often described as "traditional Indian ice cream". Kulfi is denser and creamier than regular ice cream and it comes in various flavours.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>0.5 Litre full cream milk</li>
      <li>4 slices of white bread</li>
      <li>150 grams of sugar</li>
      <li>9 cashew nuts</li>
      <li>8 almonds</li>
      <li>10 pistachio ( without salt)</li>
      <li>Kesar/ Saffron ( optional)</li>
      <li>2-3 Cardamom</li>
      <li>Coconut powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Pour the milk in a heating pan and put it for boiling. Keep the gas stove on medium flame.</li>

      <li>Take the 4 slices of plain white bread. And cut the brown sides of the bread with a knife.</li>

      <li>Chop the bread slices into smaller pieces. And grind them into fine powder in a grinder.</li>

      <li>Cut the dry fruits, cashews, pistachio, and almonds into small fine chunks, in order to add in the kulfi mixture.</li>

      <li>Once you see the milk is starting to boil. Add the bread powder to the milk and keep stirring it. Make sure that there are no balls formed in the milk.</li>

      <li>Add Kesar/saffron leaves to the mixture and keep stirring. You will see soon the milk mixture will turn yellowish in colour. Also, it will start thickening as well.</li>

      <li>Now, add the dry fruits to the mixture and keep stirring it for another 2-3 minutes. Soon the mixture will start becoming thicker and thicker.</li>

      <li>Add the sugar to the mixture and keep stirring it so the sugar gets dissolved in it. Please note, you can make it with sugar-free as well. As a bit healthier option for you.</li>

      <li>Crush the cardamon and remove the cardamom peel and the seed powder to the mixture for the sweet aroma in the kulfi.</li>

      <li>Turn off the gas stove, and let the mixture cool down for 10-15 minutes.</li>

      <li>If you have the popsicle mould / or ice cream cups, pour the mixture into it and cover them with the help of aluminium foil or the cap of the mould. Now put this in the freezer and let it cool.</li>
