    <h2> Description</h2>

    <p>The hearty butter chicken tops the chart of Indian chicken curries. The popularity of the dish nationally and globally makes it sound exquisite. However, did you know that this butter-rich recipe was created by accident after a chef at a popular indian restaurant - Moti Mahal, cooked some left over tandoori chicken in a rich butter gravy!</p>
    
    <p>It can be made at home with simple ingredients from your kitchen? No more too sweet, too tangy or too runny gravy. Here we share a Butter Chicken recipe that will give you a gravy with rich, creamy, non-greasy consistency and chicken that is juicy and high on flavour.</p>
